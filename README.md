# PhysicsLabs

The scripts I've written to automate data analysis and take accurate measurements as part of my physics degree!

The shorter experiments (typically 2 or 4 weeks) required a single Python script. My 4th year dissertation project required use of the ROOT framework to analyse GEANT4/Garfield++ simulations, all of which is written in C++.
