The scripts I've written to automate data analysis and take accurate measurements as part of my physics degree!

The shorter experiments (typically 2 or 4 weeks) required a single Python script. My 4th year dissertation project required use of the ROOT framework to analyse GEANT4/Garfield++ simulations, all of which is written in C++.

Unfortunately I appear to have lost one of my python scripts, which measured how long it takes the amplitude of a swinging pendulum to drop to a certain value. That was a great example, too - it was visual interpretation of a graph, which is easy for humans but hard for computers. I therefore had to come up with an algorithm and then implement it in Python, as well as importing the relevant data through a CSV.
