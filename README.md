The scripts I've written to automate data analysis and take accurate measurements as part of my physics degree!

The shorter experiments (typically 2 or 4 weeks) required a single Python script. My 4th year dissertation project required use of the ROOT framework to analyse GEANT4/Garfield++ simulations, all of which is written in C.

The C files: My final-year masters' dissertation project was to simulate the electric field of a prototype dark matter detector to try and find the optimum configuration using several Physics libraries and analyse the results, requiring me to write the analysis script in C++. I then had the opportunity to test what the analysis suggested was the best configuration using a real-life prototype detector the University had built!

The Python file: The Physics course involved a number of practical experiments, some of which required Python for data analysis and/or control over the experiment apparatus. This particular example is the script required to analyse a Michelson-Morley interferometer to measure changes to the speed of light (useful for e.g. determining the refractive index of a gas).

Unfortunately I appear to have lost one of my python scripts, which measured the decay of the oscillation of a torsion pendulum with a magnet stuck on it to measure the viscosity of a liquid with iron filings suspended in it.
